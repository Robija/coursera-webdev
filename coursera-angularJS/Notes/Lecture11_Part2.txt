*Expression and interpolation*

**Lazy fetchig - Lecture11: Part2**
- HTML is processed sequentially 
- e.g. <img alt="" src="images/yaakov_{{stateOfBeing}}.png">
  {{stateOfBeing}} will not be found, because AngularJS has not 
  processed the respecitve line, which as a result, will be shown
  as an 404 error in the console. 
  
- SOLUTION: instead of a standard /src/-tag, add /ng-src/-tag,
  as ab outcome, the browser fetches the image, after AngularJS
  has injected it witha value.
